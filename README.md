# Atlas - Titanium Geolocation Utilities and Providers

Atlas is a set of CommonJS JavaScript libraries that allow you to extend the existing Appcelerator Titanium mobile Geolocation functions.

## Features

Details coming soon.

## Usage

To use Atlas in your Titanium Mobile project please follow the below steps:

1. Check out the Examples folder for how to use each provider. Similar to the KitchenSink example there is a running sample on how to use each provider.
2. Some of the providers need API keys. Check the readme file in each provider directory for instructions on what is needed for each provider.
3. Copy the providers into your project and use them just like any other CommonJS library
